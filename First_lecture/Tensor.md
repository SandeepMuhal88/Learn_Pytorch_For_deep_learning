## Tensor
tensor is a multi-dimensional array that represents numbers in memory

## Why Pytorch?
Pytorch is a library for deep learning that provides a way to create and train neural networks
in tensor we chech the how many direction we have in the array

## Why Pytorch is better than other libraries?
Pytorch is better than other libraries because it is easy to use and has a lot of features

## What is the difference between tensor and array?
Tensor is a multi-dimensional array that represents numbers in memory
Array is a collection of data that is stored in a linear manner

## What is the difference between tensor and matrix?
Tensor is a multi-dimensional array that represents numbers in memory
Matrix is a two-dimensional array that represents numbers in memory
